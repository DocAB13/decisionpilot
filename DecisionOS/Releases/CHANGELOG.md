## IR01-077 — Unit tests for `core/ai/validate.ts`

**Type:** Test coverage (Phase 6, completed out of numeric order while IR01-076 remains blocked)

**Summary:** IR01-076 is blocked on missing environment secrets (see below) and cannot be advanced. Per the roadmap's own execution model ("tasks are ordered by dependency, not calendar time") and Appendix A's dependency graph, IR01-077 → IR01-078 → IR01-079 is a chain independent of IR01-076 → IR01-080 → ...: all of Phase 6's production-verification tasks (IR01-080 through IR01-085) genuinely need a live environment and stay blocked behind IR01-076, but the unit-test tasks do not. IR01-077 was next in that unblocked chain.

**Findings:** `core/ai/validate.test.ts` already existed at 620 lines (written under IR01-045/IR01-055 alongside the validation functions themselves) and was already at 96% line coverage on `validate.ts` — clearing this task's 80% bar before any new work. Only 3 lines were uncovered, all defensive branches: a non-object entry in `per_alternative`, a non-object entry in `action_items`, and a non-numeric `sequence` field.

**Changes:** Added 3 tests to `core/ai/validate.test.ts` closing those branches. `validate.ts` is now at 100% line / 97% statement / 91% branch coverage. No production code touched — `validate.ts` itself was not modified.

**Gap found, not fixed (explicitly out of scope for a test-only task):** H11 §8.5 and §9.4 both require the output validation layer to reject responses containing a defined list of prohibited phrases (outcome-prediction language, Legal-category phrases, real-time-data phrases). No such check exists anywhere in `core/ai/` — not in `validate.ts`, not as a prompt instruction in `prompts.ts`. Implementing it is new production code, which this task's scope (write unit tests) and this round's explicit instruction (do not modify production code) both exclude. Flagged for a future task.

**Note:** this task's roadmap citation of "H11 §5.5 and §6.5" is stale — those sections are now Prompt Versioning/Deprecation and Conversation Memory in the current Handbook, unrelated to output validation. The actual validation rules (already implemented and now fully tested) live in H11 §7.3, §8.3, §9.2–9.3, §11.1–11.3, and §12.1–12.2.

**Verification:** `npx vitest run` (156 tests, up from 153) and `npx tsc --noEmit` both pass.

## IR01-076 — Phase 5 E2E user flow verification

**Type:** Verification only — blocked, no code changes

**Summary:** Attempted to manually drive all five H05 user workflows end-to-end. Started `next dev` and, before opening a browser, confirmed the two write-path endpoints WF-1 and WF-5 need are reachable at all.

**Findings:**
- `POST /api/decision/create` (WF-1 step 1) → HTTP 500: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is not configured`, thrown at import time by `lib/supabase/admin.ts`.
- `POST /api/billing/checkout` (WF-5) → HTTP 500 for the same reason, via `lib/stripe/stripe.client.ts`.
- `.env.local` defines only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Every API route the five workflows touch imports `adminClient`, which requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; chat/AI analysis additionally requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; billing additionally requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID`.

**Not done:** None of the five workflows were run in a browser (Chrome, 1440px/375px) — all five fail at their first data-writing step before any UI or console-error observation is possible. This is a missing-credential environment gap, not a code defect, so no fix is within this task's scope.

**Verification:** `curl -X POST /api/decision/create` and `curl -X POST /api/billing/checkout` against a local `next dev` server, both reproducing HTTP 500 with the errors above. Dev server stopped after confirming the blocker.

## IR01-075 — `useSubscription` plan-gating verification

**Type:** Verification only — no code changes

**Summary:** Per the roadmap's own framing ("Confirm `hooks/useSubscription.js` is wired into all plan-gated components"), audited every plan-gated surface in the app rather than building anything new.

**Findings — all already correctly wired:**
- `hooks/useSubscription.js` returns exactly `{ plan, loading }`.
- `features/decision-chat/Chat.tsx` (IR01-073) gates on `plan === 'pro' || plan === 'premium'`, equivalent to the roadmap's `plan === 'free'` framing.
- `features/decision-history/History.tsx` (IR01-063) reacts to `plan_limit` from `GET /api/decision/history`, which the endpoint computes server-side as `actualTotal > 10` for free-tier users.
- `components/layout/TopNav.tsx` (IR01-058) shows the PRO/PREMIUM badge from `useSubscription`.
- Also checked (not in this task's file list): `RecommendationView.tsx` (IR01-071), `PricingSection.tsx` (IR01-074), and the legacy `App.jsx`'s own separate `TopNav` function — all already use `useSubscription` correctly.

No component was found rendering plan-based content without going through `useSubscription` or the API's `plan_limit`.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) re-confirmed green; zero files were changed for this task.

**Noted, not fixed (no user-facing impact — would be unrelated-refactor scope):** `useSubscription.js` queries the `subscriptions` table with `.single()`. Per that table's own migration comment, a row only exists once a user has gone through the Stripe webhook (i.e., first upgrade) — a free user who's never upgraded has no row at all, so this query always resolves with an unchecked "no rows" error for them. `plan` still correctly defaults to `'free'` via `data?.plan || 'free'`, and nothing is thrown or logged, so there's no visible symptom. Left as-is since fixing it means touching a hook used on every page for a purely internal correction outside this task's "confirm it's wired" scope.

## IR01-074 — Billing upgrade flow

**Type:** Feature (new component) + bug fix (pre-existing gap in a listed acceptance-criteria file)

**Summary:** Built the Stripe Checkout upgrade flow per H13 §4.1: a reusable, H08-aligned pricing component, and a working post-checkout confirmation page.

**Changes:**
- Added `features/marketing/PricingSection.tsx` + `PricingSection.module.css`: Free/Pro/Premium cards (`Card` component, H08 §6 three-column grid), plan-aware "Current plan" label via the existing `useSubscription` hook, and "Upgrade to Pro"/"Upgrade to Premium" buttons that `POST /api/billing/checkout` and redirect via `window.location.href` on success.
- Replaced the only reachable pricing cards in the app — an inline ~60-line block inside the legacy `components/App.jsx` homepage, wired to the deprecated `/api/create-checkout` — with `<PricingSection />`. No other part of that 5000-line legacy file was touched (its other, unrelated `handleUpgrade` nav-badge buttons are untouched).
- Rebuilt `pages/success.js` + new `pages/success.module.css`: it previously ignored `session_id`/`return` entirely, linked to `/` instead of `/dashboard`, and referenced the old "DecisionPilot" product name — none of which satisfied this task's own acceptance criteria. It now reads `session_id`/`return` from `router.query` (defaulting to `/dashboard` per H13 §4.1), and is built on H08 tokens reusing `Card`/`Button`.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next build`, and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) all pass. Also smoke-tested the production build with `next start`: homepage and `/success?session_id=...` both return 200 with no server errors.

**Not done (explicitly out of scope for this task):** `pages/account.tsx` still doesn't exist. `History.tsx` (IR01-063) and `Chat.tsx` (IR01-073) both already route their Free-plan upgrade prompts there, so those links still 404. IR01-074's file list only specified `PricingSection.tsx` — a dedicated account/billing page isn't listed until a future task.

## IR01-073 — AI Chat Interface

**Type:** Feature (new screen)

**Summary:** Built the AI Chat Interface per H08 §11 and H13 §3.6, anchored to a Decision Object.

**Changes:**
- Added `features/decision-chat/Chat.tsx` + `Chat.module.css`: context label header ("You are discussing your [Category] decision," always visible), scrollable message area (user right/accent-light, AI left/surface), input pinned to the bottom (1000-char max, Enter to send), auto-scroll to the latest message.
- Optimistic send: the user's message appears immediately with a "sending" state; a failed call marks it "Failed to send. Retry" inline rather than losing it.
- "Thinking" indicator while waiting for the AI response.
- Formal Update Prompt (H08 §11): when `material_change_detected` is true, an inline accent-tinted card appears with "Update Decision" / "Keep as context only" actions.
- Pro+ gate lives inside `Chat.tsx` itself (checked via the existing `useSubscription` hook): Free plan sees an inline upgrade prompt instead of the message area and input, never a redirect away from the decision (H08 UX-P6).
- Wired into `pages/decision/[id].tsx` via a `showChat` toggle on `DecisionRouter`: desktop renders a 40/60 split (current view alongside the Chat panel), mobile hides the left pane so Chat takes the full width — approximating H08 §11's full-screen mobile spec without any changes to `PageLayout`, `TopNav`, or `BottomNav`.
- Updated `RecommendationView`'s "Explore with AI" / "Ask AI a question" buttons (added in IR01-071) to call the new `onOpenChat` prop instead of `router.push('/decision/[id]/chat')` — that route was never built and only `features/decision-chat/Chat.tsx` was ever specified as a new file for this task, so Chat renders in place instead of on a separate page.

**Two honest adaptations, not new mechanisms:**
- "Update Decision" calls the already-existing, already-valid `advanceState('draft')` and closes the chat panel, returning the user to the Wizard at their resume step to edit the affected component and resubmit. There's no dedicated "auto-apply this chat-detected change" endpoint in H13, so this reuses the same backward-edit-and-reanalyze path H08 §8 already describes rather than inventing one.
- The API only returns a "source component" for `material_change_detected` responses, not for ordinary ones — so the generic "Based on your [component]" source label from H08 §11's Message Anatomy isn't shown on every AI message, since that data doesn't exist for the general case.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next build`, and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) all pass.

## IR01-072 — Final Decision capture and state advance

**Type:** Feature (new screen) + bug fix (dependency)

**Summary:** Built the Final Decision capture form (component 8) and the `decision_made` state transition, per the roadmap's IR01-072 spec.

**Changes:**
- Added `features/decision-wizard/FinalDecisionForm.tsx` + `FinalDecisionForm.module.css`: alternative selection (radio-card group per H08 §7, defaults to the recommended alternative), a `divergence_reason` field that appears only when the choice differs from the recommendation, and a `confident` / `uncertain` / `reluctant` confidence radio group.
- Submit flow: `updateComponent('8_final_decision', ...)` then `advanceState('decision_made')`, exactly as specified. A failed `advanceState` call is caught and shown inline; the decision stays in `waiting_for_user` (no client-side rollback needed — the context only updates local status after a successful response).
- Wired into `pages/decision/[id].tsx`: a local `showFinalForm` toggle switches the `waiting_for_user` branch between `RecommendationView` (its "Record My Decision" button now opens the form) and `FinalDecisionForm` (its Back button returns to the recommendation).
- Added a `decision_made` router case that reads `decision.components['9_action_plan']` and displays the plan inline (title/detail/time-estimate per item), with a graceful fallback message if the Action Plan Engine failed — matching H13 §3.5's "state transition succeeds even if the action plan generation fails" behavior.
- Added `ActionPlanContent` / `ActionPlanItem` types (component 9) to `core/decision/Decision.types.ts`, matching `ACTION_PLAN_OUTPUT_SCHEMA` in `core/ai/prompts.ts`.

**Bug fix (existing code, a hard dependency of this task):** `context/DecisionContext.tsx`'s `advanceState` posted `{ decision_id, status: to }`, but `pages/api/decision/state.ts` reads `to_status` from the body — every `advanceState()` call 400'd with "to_status is required." This predates IR01-071 (introduced with `DecisionContext` in IR01-061) and had never been exercised until this task's submit flow needed it. Fixed the field name only. `advanceState`'s signature stays `Promise<void>`, unchanged from H09's frozen interface — instead of widening the return type to carry `action_plan`, `advanceState` now merges a returned `action_plan` into local component state the same way `updateComponent` already merges every other component, so `FinalDecisionForm`/the router can read it straight from `decision.components` once the call resolves.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next build`, and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) all pass.

**Deferred:** No component-completion interactivity (checking off action items, per H08 §18's strikethrough microinteraction) — the roadmap only calls for displaying the plan after the transition, not editing it. That belongs to a later Outcome/Reflection-adjacent task, not yet scoped in IR01.

## IR01-071 — Recommendation Screen

**Type:** Feature (new screen)

**Summary:** Built the Recommendation Screen per H08 §9 and H03 component 7 — the AI's output view for a Decision in the `waiting_for_user` state.

**Changes:**
- Added `features/decision-wizard/RecommendationView.tsx` + `RecommendationView.module.css`, wired into the `waiting_for_user` branch of `pages/decision/[id].tsx` (replacing the IR01-069/070 placeholder).
- Recommendation Block: winning alternative as the visual hero (`text-2xl`/`font-black`), primary reasoning, honest trade-offs, "what would change this," and a confidence indicator dot per H11 §11.4 (no dot for high confidence, a dot for medium/low, plus the calibrated information-request sentence for each).
- Alternatives analysis: one `Card` per alternative with "Works for you" / "Worth noting" / "Watch out for" sections (pros/cons/risks from components 5 and 6), recommended alternative first with a "Recommended" badge.
- Handles the edge cases in the Recommendation Contract: a genuine tie (`tie_detected`) and the "all alternatives violate hard constraints" case (`recommended_alternative_id: null`).
- `recommendation_available: false` partial-success state: shows the saved per-alternative analysis with a "Try again" action, without inventing a new retry endpoint (H13 §3.4 notes Recommendation-only retry is post-MVP).
- Chat entry point ("Explore with AI" desktop / "Ask AI a question" mobile), gated on plan via the existing `useSubscription` hook, matching the Free-plan upgrade pattern already used in `History.tsx`.
- "Record My Decision" is pinned above the mobile bottom nav (`position: fixed; bottom: 56px`) so it's visible without scrolling; inline after the alternatives list on desktop.
- Added typed shapes for the AI-generated components — `AIAnalysisContent`, `RisksContent`, `RecommendationContent`, `AnalysisProCon`, `AnalysisRisk`, `ConstraintCompliance` — to `core/decision/Decision.types.ts`, since components 5/6/7 had no type definitions yet.

**Deferred (intentionally, by design):** `onRecordDecision` and `onRetryRecommendation` are optional callback props with no wiring yet. `onRecordDecision` will be wired by IR01-072 (Final Decision capture + `decision_made` transition). `onRetryRecommendation` has no backend endpoint to call yet — Recommendation-only retry is explicitly post-MVP per H13 §3.4.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next build`, and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) all pass.

**Note for IR01-072:** `DecisionContext.advanceState()` sends `{ status: to }` but `POST /api/decision/state` reads `to_status` — any `advanceState()` call today 400s. Pre-existing, not touched here; flagged for IR01-072 since it will be the first caller of `advanceState('decision_made')`.

## IR01-070b — UI Consistency Pass

**Type:** Consistency / cleanup (no new features, no functional change)

**Summary:** Audited every screen shipped through IR01-070 (Dashboard, History, Decision Wizard, Decision Object view, Analysis Loading, Auth) against H08 (UX & Design System) and removed the duplication and token gaps found.

**Changes:**
- Removed a near-byte-identical CSS duplicate between `pages/dashboard.module.css` and `pages/history.module.css` by extracting the shared filter/list layout into `components/layout/FilterLayout.module.css`.
- Tokenized a hardcoded button hover color: added `--color-danger-dark` to `lib/design-tokens.css` (mirrors the existing `--color-accent-dark` pattern) and referenced it from `Button.module.css` instead of a literal `#dc2626`.
- Rebuilt `pages/auth/login.tsx` and `pages/auth/signup.tsx` — previously ~150 lines of duplicated inline-style form/card/button markup each — on the existing `Input` and `Button` components plus one shared `pages/auth/Auth.module.css` page shell. Also switched their submit buttons to the standard `Button` `loading` spinner behavior instead of an ad hoc loading-text swap, aligning them with the rest of the app's button loading pattern.
- Converted `components/ui/SaveIndicator.tsx` from inline `CSSProperties` objects to a `SaveIndicator.module.css` module, matching the CSS Modules convention used by every other component.
- Widened `Input`'s `label` prop from `string` to `React.ReactNode` (backward compatible) to support inline hint text without a one-off component.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next build`, and `npx vitest run` (153 tests) all pass with no changes to existing test files.

**Not changed (scope boundary):** The public marketing site (`pages/index.js`, `about.js`, `guides/*`, etc.) uses a separate legacy component set (`components/App.jsx`, `AselMascot`, `HeroBanner`, `GuideLayout`) that predates H08 and is outside Phase 5 IR01 scope — left untouched.
